Tracking Anything in High Quality (HQTrack) is a framework for high performance video object tracking and segmentation.
It mainly consists of a Video Multi-Object Segmenter (VMOS) and a Mask Refiner (MR), can track multiple target objects at the same time and output accurate object masks.

:beer: **HQTrack obtains runner-up in the Visual Object Tracking and Segmentaion (VOTS2023) challenge.**

## :calendar:TODO
 - [x] Demo (can be run locally).
 - [x] Training codes.
 - [ ] Interactive WebUI
 - [ ] Lightweight version for computing-friendly.

## :loudspeaker:News
- [2023/8/17] We release the training codes.
- [2023/7/30] We provide a demo code that can be run locally.
- [2023/7/22] We author a [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13974) for HQTrack.
- [2023/7/3] HQTrack ranks the 2nd place in the VOTS2023 challenge.

We also provide a [demo script](demo/demo.py), which supports box and point prompts as inputs. This is a pure python script that allows the user to test arbitrary videos.

## :car:Run HQTrack
* Model Preparation

Download VMOS model from [Google Driver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hh10hLtz3YL_zE3PfBCiLB0tvj3Yvv26?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Driver](https://pan.baidu.com/s/120iNn5OEVrqDz0SKjEooig?pwd=vots) and put it under
```
/path/to/HQTrack/result/default_InternT_MSDeAOTL_V2/YTB_DAV_VIP/ckpt/
```
Download [HQ-SAM_h](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qobFYrI4eyIANfBSmYcGuWRaSIXfMOQ8/view?usp=sharing) and put it under
```
/path/to/HQTrack/segment_anything_hq/pretrained_model/
```


* Initialize the vots workspace
```
cd /path/to/VOTS23_workspace
vot initialize tests/multiobject
```
* Copy our trackers.ini to your vot workspace
```
cp /path/to/our/trackers.ini /path/to/VOTS23_workspace/trackers.ini
```
* Modify your path in trackers.ini
* test the tracker and pack the results
```
bash run.sh
```

## :dolphin:Training
### Stage 1
In stage 1, we pre-train VMOS on synthetic video sequences generated from static image datasets.
We refer readers to [AFB-URR](https://github.com/xmlyqing00/AFB-URR) for preparing the pre-train datasets.
The Static dataset should be put in 
```
/path/to/HQTrack/datasets/
```
* Download [pre-trained backbone model](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternImage/resolve/main/internimage_t_1k_224.pth) and put it under
```
/path/to/HQTrack/pretrain_models/
```
* Transfer the backbone ckpt to meet VMOS model
```
python my_tools/transfer_intern_pretrained_model.py
```
* Set the relevant training args in
```
/path/to/HQTrack/configs/pre.py
```
* Start stage 1 pre-training by running:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="1" python tools/train.py --amp \
	--exp_name "Static_Pre" \
	--stage "pre" \
	--model "internT_msdeaotl_v2" \
	--gpu_num "1"
```

### Stage 2
In stage 2, video multi-object segmentation datasets are employed for training, e.g., DAVIS and YoutubeVOS.
* Prepare the datasets and put them under 
```
/path/to/HQTrack/datasets/
```
* Start stage 2 training by running:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="1" python tools/train.py --amp \
	--exp_name "default" \
	--stage "ytb_vip_dav_deaot_internT" \
	--model "internT_msdeaotl_v2" \
	--gpu_num "1"
```
You can include more training datasets such as VIPSeg, BURST, MOTS, and OVIS for better performance.
